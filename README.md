## ü™¥ Digital Compost

### Project Overview

Digital Compost is a personal website that serves as a centralized hub for notes, articles, and real-time updates from various web sources. The site combines personal markdown notes with external content from Google Alerts RSS feeds and YouTube videos, providing a single, curated view of information. The project is deployed on Vercel and uses serverless functions to fetch and process data, ensuring a fast and dynamic user experience.

### ‚ú® Features

  * **Markdown Notes**: Display personal notes and articles fetched from an Airtable base. Content is rendered in-browser using `marked.js`.
  * **Combined RSS Feeds**: Fetches and merges content from multiple Google Alerts RSS feeds. The logic filters content from one feed to enrich the other, and a robust client-side parser ensures reliable display.
  * **YouTube Integration**: Fetches the latest YouTube videos related to specific topics using the YouTube Data API.
  * **Responsive Design**: The site's layout is built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring it is fully responsive and looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
  * **Serverless Architecture**: All external data fetching is handled by a Vercel serverless function, keeping the client-side code clean and secure.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

  * **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript
  * **Backend**: Vercel Serverless Functions (Node.js)
  * **APIs**:
      * **Airtable API**: For fetching personal notes.
      * **Google Alerts RSS Feeds**: For fetching news articles.
      * **YouTube Data API v3**: For fetching videos.
  * **Libraries**:
      * `rss-parser`: Parses RSS feed XML into a usable format.
      * `axios`: Makes HTTP requests to the YouTube API.
      * `marked.js`: Renders markdown content in the browser.
